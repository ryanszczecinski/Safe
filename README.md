# Safe
Embedded Binary Safe 

Has a locked state and a program state, Uses AVR Micrcontroller 

In the locked state it will have two LEDs on, a green and yellow. 
Will wait for a 6 bit code to be entered, then will proceed into the locked state

In the locked state it will wait for 6 bits to be entered. Once 6 bits are entered, it will check 
to see if it is the correct pattern. Safe will remain locked if the wrong code is entered.
